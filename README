A collection of bugfixes and patches for Dexter's 1.3 ROM


Summary:
---------

 * Extended power menu (adds Reboot, Recovery)

 * Performance and library tweaks (xavwanted)

 * Add conservative governor (c19932, nadlabak)

 * Improve SD card read performance (reverendkjr)

 * memhack (khalpowers) moves dalvik-cache to either /cache or /sd-ext
   Note: Default moves dalvik-cache to /cache
   Note: Will use /sd-ext/dalvik-cache instead if it exists
         (see also "User control of /sd-ext" below)

 * minfree memory parameters tweaked
   Note: Parameters from AutoKiller Memory Optimizer database
         http://andrs.w3pla.net/autokiller/list/currentType/378
         http://andrs.w3pla.net/autokiller/list/currentType/591

 * Fix milestone overclock persistence

 * Autodetects ext2/3 (kousik)

 * ext2/3 partition is checked and possibly repaired on boot

 * Disable automatic apps2ext. Native Froyo App2SD is not affected.
   Note: See also "User control of /sd-ext" below
   Note: apps2ext used to be called app2sd before native Froyo App2SD
         (apps2fat) existed. Confusing!

 * Add support for Link2SD (see user control of /sd-ext below)
   Note: See also "User control of /sd-ext" below

 * User control of /sd-ext through manual creation of directories
      /sd-ext/app (move /data/app to /sd-ext [apps2ext])
      /sd-ext/dalvik-cache (move /data/dalvik-cache to /sd-ext)
      /sd-ext/app-private (move /data/app-private to /sd-ext)
      /sd-ext/link2sd (enable Link2SD 1.5.1 support)
   Note: apps2ext has priority over link2sd and overrides!
         It doesn't make sense to use both!

 * Replaces /system/oc with modular scripts in /system/etc/init.c



ChangeLog:
----------

2011/03/16 stock221v13-bugfix-3:

 * Add extended power menu.

   Note: Mucho thanks to untermench's 
         "[REF] How to add Reboot to power menu (updated 10/21/2010)"
         http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=8674580&postcount=1

   Note: How this deals with the XT720's bootstrapped OpenRecovery

         Unlike the Milestone (which has a vulnerable recovery), the
         XT720 uses a bootstrapped recovery. To trigger openrecovery
         boot, Skrilax's modified the "reboot" to create a
         /cache/.boot_to_or file. This file can't be created by the
         2000 user that the power menu runs as, so we have to switch
         to root to create the file. Unfortunately, SuperUser doesn't
         like running during a shutdown and even if you move the check
         to earlier (say when the power button appears) SuperUser's
         accept permissions screen appears behind the power menu and
         the button is completely obscured so you can't grant
         permissions. Also, suid shell scripts don't work. It is
         possible to create a non-suid script that runs su to create
         the file, but setup for getting the SuperUser permissions to
         work is not user-friendly enough. So instead I build a
         super-simple single-purpose binary that can be run suid
         (/system/xbin/boot_to_or):

            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <unistd.h>

            int main()
            {
               setuid( 0 );
               (void)fopen("/cache/.boot_to_or", "w");
               return 0;
            }

 * Add conservative governor.

 * Set read ahead for sdcard to 2MB

2011/03/16 stock221v13-bugfix-2:

 * Set minfree at boot (/system/etc/init.d/00_minfree)
   Note: Parameters from AutoKiller Memory Optimizer database
         http://andrs.w3pla.net/autokiller/list/currentType/378
         http://andrs.w3pla.net/autokiller/list/currentType/591
   Note: Uses 1536,2048,4096,10240,12800,15360
         (corresponds to 6mb,8mb,16mb,40mb,50mb,60mb)
   Note: This corresponds to AutoKiller Memory Optimzer's "Optimum"
         preset.

 * Implement memhack: move dalvik-cache from /data to /cache. This is
   also default behavior (However, dalvik-cache will be sent to
   /sd-ext/dalvik-cache instead if it exists).

 * Apply xavwanted's egl.cfg performance tweak.

 * Apply xavwanted's newer updated media libraries.

 * Fix typo'd filenames:
      /system/bin/fmradioserver1 
         -> /system/bin/fmradioserver
      /system/usr/keylayout/qwerty.kl1
         -> /system/usr/keylayout/qwerty.kl
      /system/usr/keychars/qwerty.kcm.bin1
         -> /system/usr/keychars/qwerty.kcm.bin

 * Delay calling /system/etc/init.c/ until just after both /data and
   /cache are available (for memhack)

 * Add some logging to 05_overclock and 10_sdext

 * 10_sdext uses "e2fsck -p" instead of "e2fsck -y"



2011/02/24 stock221v13-bugfix-1:

 * Replace /system/oc with modular scripts in /system/etc/init.c/
      00_interactive (load interactive governor),
      05_overclock (load milestone overclock),
      10_sdext (manage /sd-ext partition, app2ext, Link2SD, etc)

 * Fix milestone overclock persistence (05_overclock)

   Milestone Overclock's preferences are parsed from the XML in
   /data/data and the sdcard and are applied after oc-settings.
   oc-settings is now dos2unix transformed before execution.

 * Improved for managment of /sd-ext (10_sdext)

    * Add kousik's ext2/3 mount autodetection hack

    * Perform e2fsck before mounting /sd-ext (modeled on CyanogenMod)
      [/system/xbin/e2fsck copied from OpenRecovery/sbin/e2fsck-or]

    * Use "-o noatime,nodiratime" (modeled on CyanogenMod)

    * Allow more control of /sd-ext. Users enable or disable features
      by creating directories on /sd-ext

      /sd-ext/app          (mode /data/app to /sd-ext [apps2sd])
      /sd-ext/dalvik-cache (move /data/dalvik-cache to /sd-ext)
      /sd-ext/app-private  (move /data/app-private to /sd-ext)
      /sd-ext/link2sd      (enable Link2SD 1.5.1 support)

    * apps2sd/app2ext is nolonger automatically enabled. To enable
      apps2sd create an /sd-ext/app directory and reboot. If you've
      already have /sd-ext/app no changes are needed.

    * Allow dalvik-cache to be moved to /sd-ext (create
      /sd-ext/dalvik-cache to enable).

 * Add support for Link2SD 1.5.1 (create /sd-ext/link2sd to enable)
   Link2SD support will only be enabled if both /sd-ext/link2sd exists
   AND /sd-ext/app does not exist. 

   Note: Link2SD now has an option to move corresponding dalvik-cache
         with apps to /sd-ext. DON'T mix this with moving the entire
         dalvik-cache to /sd-ext/dalvik-cache. Pick one or the other.
      


Usage:
------

1) Build the update

    ./build-update.sh patchname

   This will create an OpenRecovery update called patchname.zip inside
   the updates/ directory.

2) Copy the update into OpenRecovery/updates/ on the sdcard.

3) Boot into OpenRecovery.

4) Use "Apply Update" menu option and select your update.



Notes:
------

 * Not compatible with 1.2a.

 * The contents of src/system/ramdisk/ becomes the root filesystem
   after 2ndinit. /system/ramdisk.tar is build automatically from this
   directory by build script.

 * The generated patch uses the unsigned, nobinary OpenRecovery update
   method because I don't know any better and I don't know what are
   the advantages of the more complicated types.

 * git does not currently track empty directories so .gitignore files
   are present inside directories that are intended to be empty such
   as src/system/ramdisk/sd-ext. The build script excludes all
   .gitignore files.

 * The build script creates META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script
   from META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script.in.  Currently all
   this does is update personalize display when the update is applied
   in OpenRecovery to include the patchname.

 * Be sure to set file ownership and permissions in
   patch/META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script.in

 * The ./build-update.sh build script has been tested on Debian,
   Ubuntu and MacOS X systems but doesn't do anything wierd. It needs
   bash, GNU tar, sed, and zip.

 * Thanks to Dexter and all the other wonderful, friendly contributers
   on XDA.
