A collection of bugfixes and patches for Dexter's 1.2 ROM


ChangeLog:
----------

2011/02/24 stock221v12-bugfix-1:

 * xavwanted's libOMX and MediaGallery.apk which seems to fix HD
   recording and playback

 * Riley600's interactive governor fix

 * Dexter's 1.2b callwaiting fix

 * kousik's mount-o typo fix

 * move /oc to /system/oc


Usage:
------

1) Build the update

    ./build-update.sh patchname

   This will create an OpenRecovery update called patchname.zip inside
   the updates/ directory.

2) Copy the update into OpenRecovery/updates/ on the sdcard.

3) Boot into OpenRecovery.

4) Use "Apply Update" menu option and select your update.


Notes:
------

 * Not compatible with 1.2a.

 * The contents of src/system/ramdisk/ becomes the root filesystem
   after 2ndinit. /system/ramdisk.tar is build automatically from this
   directory by build script.

 * The generated patch uses the unsigned, nobinary OpenRecovery update
   method because I don't know any better and I don't know what are
   the advantages of the more complicated types.

 * git does not currently track empty directories so .gitignore files
   are present inside directories that are intended to be empty such
   as src/system/ramdisk/sd-ext. The build script excludes all
   .gitignore files.

 * The build script creates META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script
   from META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script.in.  Currently all
   this does is update personalize display when the update is applied
   in OpenRecovery to include the patchname.

 * Be sure to set file ownership and permissions in
   patch/META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script.in

 * The ./build-update.sh build script has been tested on Debian and
   Ubuntu systems but doesn't do anything wierd. It basically just
   needs bash, GNU tar, sed, and zip.

 * Thanks to Dexter and all the other wonderful, friendly contributers
   on XDA.

 * Development follows discussions and feedback on
