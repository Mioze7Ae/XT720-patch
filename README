A collection of bugfixes and patches for Dexter's 1.2 ROM

Usage:
------

1) Create a patch

    ./make-patch.sh

   This will create a date and timestamped patch-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip
   that can be copied to the OpenRecovery/updates folder on the
   sdcard. Renaming the zip file after it's been generate is not a
   problem (i.e. mypatch.zip). Pick something memorable.

2) Copy patch to OpenRecovery/updates on the sdcard

3) Boot into OpenRecovery

4) Use "Apply Update" menu option and select your update


Notes:
------

 * Not compatible with 1.2a.

 * The contents of ramdisk/ becomes /system/ramdisk.tar which becomes
   the root filesystem after 2ndinit.

 * The generated patch uses the unsigned, nobinary OpenRecovery update
   method because I don't know any better.

 * Because git does not currently track empty directories, .gitignore
   files are present inside directories such as ramdisk/emmc. When
   creating patch/system/ramdisk.tar from ramdisk/, make-patch.sh
   excludes all .gitignore files.

 * Be sure to modify patch/META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script
   to set file ownership and permissions.

 * The ./make-patch.sh build script has been tested on Debian and
   Ubuntu but doesn't do anything wierd. It basically just needs bash,
   tar, and zip.

 * Thanks to Dexter and all the other wonderful, friendly contributers
   on XDA.

 * Development follows discussions and feedback on
