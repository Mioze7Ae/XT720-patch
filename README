ChangeLog:
----------

2011/02/26 xavwanted-1.2-bugfix-1:

 * Riley600's interactive governor fix

 * kousik's mount-o typo fix

 * Replace /oc with modular scripts in /system/etc/init.c/
      00_interactive (load interactive governor),
      05_overclock (load milestone overclock),
      10_sdext (manage /sd-ext partition, app2ext, Link2SD, etc)

 * Add Milestone Overclock

 * Fix milestone overclock persistence (05_overclock)

   Milestone Overclock's preferences are parsed from the XML in
   /data/data and the sdcard and are applied after oc-settings.
   oc-settings is now dos2unix transformed before execution.

 * Improved for managment of /sd-ext (10_sdext)

    * Add kousik's ext2/3 mount autodetection hack

    * Perform e2fsck before mounting /sd-ext (modeled on CyanogenMod)
      [/system/xbin/e2fsck copied from OpenRecovery/sbin/e2fsck-or]

    * Use "-o noatime,nodiratime" (modeled on CyanogenMod)

    * Allow more control of /sd-ext. Users enable or disable features
      by creating directories on /sd-ext

      /sd-ext/app          (mode /data/app to /sd-ext [apps2sd])
      /sd-ext/dalvik-cache (move /data/dalvik-cache to /sd-ext)
      /sd-ext/app-private  (move /data/app-private to /sd-ext)
      /sd-ext/link2sd      (enable Link2SD 1.5.1 support)

    * apps2sd/app2ext is nolonger automatically enabled. To enable
      apps2sd create an /sd-ext/app directory and reboot. If you've
      already have /sd-ext/app no changes are needed.

    * Allow dalvik-cache to be moved to /sd-ext (create
      /sd-ext/dalvik-cache to enable).

 * Add support for Link2SD 1.5.1 (create /sd-ext/link2sd to enable)
   Link2SD support will only be enabled if both /sd-ext/link2sd exists
   AND /sd-ext/app does not exist. 

   Note: Link2SD now has an option to move corresponding dalvik-cache
         with apps to /sd-ext. DON'T mix this with moving the entire
         dalvik-cache to /sd-ext/dalvik-cache. Pick one or the other.
